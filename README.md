## 🤖 Features

- ⚡ Instantly scaffolds Astro `.astro` components with prop typing
- 🧪 Generates Vitest-compatible test files with a DOM setup
- 🧩 Supports automatic folder structuring and consistent naming conventions
- 🛠️ Optional flags for dry-run, overwrite protection, and verbose output
- 🌌 Light-weight and zero-config - just run and go

<br>
<br>

## 🕵🏼 Usage

Bootstrap Astro components into a target directory with zero config:

```bash
npx "@igor.dvlpr/astro-component" <dest>
```

This will scaffold a test-ready Astro component suite into `<dest>`, complete with:

- 🚀 Component and entrypoint code
- 🧪 Vitest setup
- 🧩 DOM environment
- ⚙️ Render logic
- 📦 Props and slots
- 🧼 Clean file structure

<br>
<br>

To preview the generated files without writing anything, use the --dry flag:

```bash
npx "@igor.dvlpr/astro-component" <dest> --dry
```

You'll get a full log of what would be created, ideal for safe inspection before committing.
